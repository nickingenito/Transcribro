00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,880
The Speech-to-Text API provides two endpoints, transcription and translation based upon your

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,440
state-of-the-art open source large V2 Whisper model.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,340
They can be used to transcribe audio into whatever language the audio is in, translate

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,640
and transcribe the audio into English.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,000
The uploads are currently limited to 25 MB and the following input file types are supported

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,760
MP3, MP4, MPEG, MPGA, M4A, WAV and WEB.

Quick Stats Transcription

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,800
The Transcription API taks as an input audio file you want to transcribe and describes

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,560
output file formats for the transcription of the audio.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,760
We currently support multiple input and output files.

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,240
By default, the response typ will be JSON with the raw text included.

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,600
Texts imagine the wildest ideas that you have ever had and you are curious about how it

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,280
might scale to something that is a 100, 1000 times bigger.

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,600
To set additional parameters in the request, you can add more dash dash form lines with

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,320
the relevant options.

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,120
For example, if you want to set the output format as text, you would add the following

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,880
line.

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,160
The Transcription API takes as an input the audio file in any of the supported languages

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,640
and transcribe, if necessary, the audio to English.

20
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,320
It differs from our transcription endpoints since the output is not the original input

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,120
language and is instead translated to English text.

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,160
Hello, my name is Wolfgang and I come from Germany.

23
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,680
Where are you heading today?
