# Transcribro Project Documentation

Welcome to the Transcribro project documentation. This project consists of a client and a server component, each with its own setup, usage instructions, and development guidelines. Below you will find links to the specific documentation for each part of the project.

## Project Overview

Transcribro is an application designed to transcribe audio files into text, offering an intuitive interface for users to interact with their transcriptions. The project is divided into two main components:

- **Client**: A React-based frontend that provides the user interface.
- **Server**: A FastAPI-based backend responsible for processing audio files and managing transcriptions.
